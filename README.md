- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Framework:** Jetpack Compose
- **Features:** MVVM architecture, LiveData, Navigation, Retrofit, Coroutines, JWT-based auth

### Backend
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Framework:** Spring Boot (Microservices)
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL (RDS), AWS S3
- **Auth:** OAuth2, JWT
- **Infra:** Docker, AWS ECS, JMeter

## Setup Instructions

### Backend
1. Clone the backend repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaurya-afk/swiftcart-backend.git
   cd swiftcart-backend
    ```

2. Configure `.env` or `application.yml` with DB credentials, S3 keys, JWT secret.
3. Build and run:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Frontend (Android)

1. Clone the frontend repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaurya-afk/swiftcart-frontend.git
   cd swiftcart-frontend
   ```
2. Open in Android Studio.
3. Set base API URL and JWT keys in a local `secrets.properties`.
4. Run on emulator or device.
